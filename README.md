# Icarus-Mods
A collection of mods I have created for the game Icarus!

# Compatability
All mods here should be compatible with Single Player, Multiplayer, and hosted Dediated servers.

# Pleb's Stacks v1.0
This is my 1st mod. It changes almost all stack sizes of items in the game.

Resources such as wood, stone, fiber, ores, ingots, etc. now stack to 5,000.

Building item components such as wells, floors, roofs, etc. now stack to 100.

All ammo for bow's and firearms now stack to 500.

Food like berries, meats, etc. stack to 1000.

Also included in this mod is Pleb's Better Fuel Canister mod which makes (1) MXC Fuel Canister last for 24 real-time hours in a generator. This also comes pre-filled. (MXC Fuel Canister can be found in the Orbital Workshop)
